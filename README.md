The objective of this project is to display a simple counter through the screen that shows the time interval of the page. When the page is reload, the counter starts again.
This is a simple project designed to put in practice the React skills learned, and to improve the hability to work with components and the files structure of a framework.

React improves the creation of custom components, which you can render throughout your web-app using the ReactDOM.render() method. A custom component allows you to divide and conquer, separating logical and visual challenges into smaller pieces- giving you greater control over the display and functionalities of each part of the web-app you are developing.

### Instructions

1. Create a seconds-counter component, called SecondsCounter. It should look like this one.
2. The whole purpose of the component is to display how many seconds have passed since the website finished loading (onLoad).
3. Use the ReactDOM.render() to render the component into the web-app.
4. Use the setInterval() function to re-render de component on every second.
5. The component does not need a local state.

(You can find the clock icon on the left of the component in Font Awesome)

Given an index.html document, the app.js file must modify the DOM in order to:

##### REMEMBER: 

Once the progress and flow of the project is finished, you must commit and push the repository remotely, using the following command:

```
$ git add . 
$ git commit -m "Message"
$ git push origin repo-remote
```

This template is similar to create-react-app but it's meant for 4Geeks Academy students.

##### and install the npm package:
```
$ npm install
```
## Start coding!

For Windows, Mac, Linux or Gitpod, start the webpack server with live reload:
```
$ npm run start
```

You can update the `styles/index.scss` or `js/index.js` depending on your needs.
Add more files into your, `./src/js/components` or styles folder as you need them.
